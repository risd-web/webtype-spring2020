* WEB TYPE (RISD GRAPH-2313-01)
* 3 credits
* Marie Otsuka (motsuka@risd.edu)

> This course explores typography within the browser, considering the web not as a container but as a medium. Students will develop typography that activates the capacities and conditions of websites and will explore typographic systems that evolve through use. We will begin by first responding to different device environments locally, then expand our parameters to the remote network. Discussions will examine how publishing on the internet entails a distinct form of readership and engagement. Technical instruction will include basic web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as type design technology such as variable fonts. Background in coding is recommended but not required. 

## Schedule
* Thursdays, 1:10pm – 6:10pm
* Design Center Room 407
* Office Hours / Review Sessions: TBD, by appointment


## Course objectives
* understand the technology involved in implementing a website
* produce working prototypes of web pages
* gain a working knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript/Jquery
* use the browser as a place for experimentation
* recognize how information is distributed online
* discuss and analyze the web as a very specific public space, with its own communities, forms of engagement, modes of communication
* participate in an open-source coding environment
* learn how to find answers online to coding problems


## Prerequisites
* basic typography
* a willingness to explore the web in all its many forms, uses, and aesthetics
* a curiosity for technical tools and concepts
* a tenacity for trial & error

## Exercises and Projects
Exercises are quick assignments for practicing or extending material covered in class. Projects are larger assignments to shape your own content.
* We will have 3 prompted projects and 1 proposed final project over the course of the semester.
* We will workshop exercises as needed, to be completed during class.

## Readings
Readings will be assigned every week. We will discuss the readings in class, in relation to work out in the public and by your peers. Each student must submit a brief response and 1 question to the appropriate Slack channel the night before the assigned reading is due. Your responses may also be replies to existing comments. Questions should be oriented for in-class discussion, directed to your fellow students. Be prepared to discuss the texts in class. 

## Presentations
Each student will give a 10-15 minute presentation on a UI element. You should research your topic and present the class with a) its function, b) its aesthetics, demonstrating a full range of its iterations, and c) its history / context / implications. Format: as appropriate. Here is a [list of possible topics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lvXOdo6AJhGLYveICQkM4CksIfA1M4ehr-r8GrXNt6o/edit#gid=248565475).

## Diversity
It’s important to me that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives are well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs are addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity students bring to this class are viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit.  I am working to present materials and activities that challenge accepted canons and are respectful and representative of diversity: gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, culture, perspective, and other background characteristics. Your suggestions about how to improve the value of diversity in this course are always encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know how I might improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.


## Attendance
One unexcused absence and your letter grade drops by one, i.e. from A to a B. Two unexcused absences and you will be dropped from the course. Two late arrivals without prior arrangements equals one unexcused absence. Students who have been absent are expected to have their work completed the class session following their return. To obtain an excused absence, you must both write the instructor in advance and bring in medical documentation.
