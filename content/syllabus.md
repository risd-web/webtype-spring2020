* WEB TYPE (RISD GRAPH-2313-01)
* 3 credits
* Marie Otsuka (motsuka@risd.edu)

> This course explores typography within the browser, considering the web not as a container but as a medium. We will develop typography that activates the capacities and conditions of websites. Projects will first respond our local browser conditions and different device environments, then expand to working with the remote network as source material. Critique and discussions will examine how publishing on the internet allows for a distinct form of engagement. Technical instruction includes basic web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as type design technology such as variable fonts. Background in coding is recommended but not required. 

## Schedule
* Thursdays, 1:10pm – 6:10pm

## Course objectives
* use the browser as a platform for expression and experimentation
* discuss and analyze the web as a very specific public space, with its own communities, forms of engagement, modes of communication
* understand the technology involved in implementing a website, specifically in exercising typographic control

## Readings
Readings will be dispersed throughout the curriculum to inform and contextualize our work.

## Show & Tell
Every class, we will begin by sharing an interesting website we’ve come across over the past week.

## Diversity
It’s important to me that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives are well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs are addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity students bring to this class are viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit.  I am working to present materials and activities that challenge accepted canons and are respectful and representative of diversity: gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, culture, perspective, and other background characteristics. Your suggestions about how to improve the value of diversity in this course are always encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know how I might improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.

## Attendance
One unexcused absence and your letter grade drops by one, i.e. from A to a B. Two unexcused absences and you will be dropped from the course. Two late arrivals without prior arrangements equals one unexcused absence. Students who have been absent are expected to have their work completed the class session following their return. To obtain an excused absence, you must both write the instructor in advance and bring in medical documentation.

## Grading
* 60% Execution of projects and exercises
* 30% Participation in critiques, class discussions, and readings
