This course is purposely named with shortened, less precise versions these words to broaden our view into our explorations.

*Type* could refer to typography — the arrangement of letterforms — but also typefaces themselves, and the quality of letterforms.

*Web* could refer to websites, but also to the web infrastructure, to the technology and culture of the world wide web.

Both are fundamental for communication: one capturing its visual form, the other a medium for its distribution. As designers, it is essential that we can critically create work that thrives at their intersection.
