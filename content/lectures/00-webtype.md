This course is purposely named with shortened, less precise versions the words ‚Äúweb‚Äù and ‚Äútype‚Äù to broaden our perspective on our explorations.

*Web* could refer to websites, but also to the web infrastructure, to the technology and culture of the world wide web; the protocols that compose the fabric of our internet; the act of weaving a web.

*Type* could refer to typography ‚Äî the arrangement of letterforms ‚Äî but also typefaces themselves, the quality of letterforms; to type, the act of typing, or writing, or coding.

Both are fundamental for communication: one capturing its visual form, the other a medium for its distribution. As designers, it is essential that we can critically create work that thrives at their intersection.

## Web


Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN, launched [The World Wide Web Project](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) in 1989. The project was initially created to streamline distribution of information among scientists around the world. Berners-Lee devised the system of hypertext (or links.) This first website was dedicated to host information about the World Wide Web itself.

The internet is a network of connected computers with the primary purpose to share information. It works as bunch of conversations between clients and servers.
- *Web Client:* Browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc..)
- *Web Server:* Internet-connected computers running server software, serving web documents as requested.  

Despite [popular depictions](https://noahveltman.com/internet-shape/) of the internet as a massless, nebulous entity, it requires a massive physical infrastructure powered by  electrical energy, including data centers, servers, airconditioners, and [cables](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/10/technology/internet-cables-oceans.html).

## Web as medium

From the begining stage of the web, [artists](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) embraced the browser as a platform. It nodes of [personal expression](https://www.cameronsworld.net/), or [abstract painting](http://www.abstractbrowsing.net/). Artist even used the [infrastracture of the web](http://xn--9l7a.com/)itself. 

It is in this spirit that we will engage in typographic explorations.

### Web languages

3 essential technologies (front-end web development) determines what we see and interact with on the web.

1. Content in HTML / `.html`
2. Form in CSS / `.css`
3. Behavior in Javascript / `.js`


Back-end technologies are used to compile several sources of the website together, whether through a database or static site generator. CMS (content management systems) like Wordpress are an example of systems that integrate all of this: how the information is collected, stored, and compiled into a website. 

In our class, we will be focusing on frontend languages to develop the skills needed to shape text within the browser.

Let‚Äôs start with [HTML]().
