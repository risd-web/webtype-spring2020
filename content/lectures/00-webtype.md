This course is purposely named with shortened, less precise versions the words ‚Äúweb‚Äù and ‚Äútype‚Äù to broaden our perspective on our explorations.

*Web* could refer to websites, but also to the web infrastructure, to the technology and culture of the world wide web; the protocols that compose the fabric of our internet; the act of weaving a web.

*Type* could refer to typography ‚Äî the arrangement of letterforms ‚Äî but also typefaces themselves, the quality of letterforms; to type, the act of typing, or writing, or coding.

Both are fundamental for communication: one capturing its visual form, the other a medium for its distribution. As designers, it is essential that we can critically create work that thrives at their intersection.

## Our Tools

- This website is a work-in-progress
- [Demos repository](https://github.com/risd-web/webtype-demo)

### Github
[GitHub](https://github.com/)is a web-based repository hosting service based on the Git version control and source code management system. GitHub allows individuals and teams of programmers to manage, share, store and make editable revisions to projects. We will be using Github‚Äôs code sharing and publishing service to store our class projects. 

* A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and make a repository for this class.
	- This will become part of the url for where upload your projects
	- Avoid spaces
* Review Git Version control or download [GitHub Mac client](https://desktop.github.com/)
- See more on [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/)

### Text Editor
* Download [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

<!-- * Get the free trial [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/buy) (but don‚Äôt start it yet.) If you'd like to purchase it, checkout [student discounts](https://glyphsapp.com/buy/discount). -->
* Free account at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

### Browser
* Assignments will be evaluated in [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for its Inspector tools

### Slack?
* [Join Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/webtypeworkspace/shared_invite/enQtOTUxNDc5NzU5MDc5LWE0NzJkZWFmYTNjYTY3YjVmNDE5ZjU0NWU2MjFkNGI3OWE0NzM3YTUyZGM3MjZhMzdiNDA2MDkzZjNmZTcyZDk)


## Web infrastructure

Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN, launched [The World Wide Web Project](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) in 1989. The project was initially created to streamline distribution of information among scientists around the world. Berners-Lee devised the system of hypertext (or links.) This first website was dedicated to host information about the World Wide Web itself.

The internet is a network of connected computers with the primary purpose to share information. It works as bunch of conversations between clients and servers.
- *Web Client:* Browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc..)
- *Web Server:* Internet-connected computers running server software, serving web documents as requested.  

Despite [popular depictions](https://noahveltman.com/internet-shape/) of the internet as a massless, nebulous entity, it requires a massive physical infrastructure powered by  electrical energy, including data centers, servers, airconditioners, and [cables](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/10/technology/internet-cables-oceans.html).
- [What‚Äôs Important About Underwater Internet Cables](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/submarine-cables/414942/)
- [Map of the Internet](https://classic.qz.com/map-of-the-internet/)


## Web as medium

From the begining stage of the web, [artists](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) embraced the browser as a platform. It nodes of [personal expression](https://www.cameronsworld.net/), or [abstract painting](http://www.abstractbrowsing.net/). Artist even used the [infrastracture of the web](http://xn--9l7a.com/)itself. 

It is in this spirit that we will engage in typographic explorations.

### Web languages

3 essential technologies (front-end web development) determines what we see and interact with on the web.

1. Content in HTML / `.html`
2. Form in CSS / `.css`
3. Behavior in Javascript / `.js`


Back-end technologies are used to compile several sources of the website together, whether through a database or static site generator. CMS (content management systems) like Wordpress are an example of systems that integrate all of this: how the information is collected, stored, and compiled into a website. 

In our class, we will be focusing on frontend languages to develop the skills needed to shape text within the browser.
