## Web Type

This course is purposely named with shortened, less precise versions these words to broaden our perspective on our explorations.

*Web* could refer to websites, but also to the web infrastructure, to the technology and culture of the world wide web; the protocols that compose the fabric of our internet; the act of weaving a web.

*Type* could refer to typography ‚Äî the arrangement of letterforms ‚Äî but also typefaces themselves, the quality of letterforms; to type, the act of typing, or writing, or coding.

Both are fundamental for communication: one capturing its visual form, the other a medium for its distribution. As designers, it is essential that we can critically create work that thrives at their intersection.

And also maybe: ü¶Ü üê∏ üêßü¶éü¶¢

## Web?

### 1989
Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN, invents the World Wide Web.
The project was initially created to streamline distribution of information among scientists around the world. Berners-Lee devised the system of hypertext (or links)
The first website was dedicated to host information about the World Wide Web project itself

# ‚ÄúUser Experience‚Äù

## The 5Es Experience Framework, Keetra Dean Dixon
* How would you like people to move through the experience?
* How can you attract them and keep them engaged?

1. Entice
* How are visitors invited to participate?
* How are they invited to the space in the first place?

2. Enter
* What is the threshold moment where a visitor transitions from their world to yours?

3. Engage
* How do visitors interact? How do they know how to interact? How do they engage with one another?

4. Exit
* How do visitors know when they are done? What is the second threshold‚Äì the transition back into the real world?

5. Extend
* How do guests continue to participate? Is there a take-home or social opportunity?

Closing the circle
* This cycle can span an entire event, a whole space, or just a single piece of an interaction.

> By writing directly into a mechanical form rather than a manuscript (as we‚Äôre doing right now) the writer would be working closer to the nature of the multiplied result, and through an increasing awareness and gradual mastery of the form‚Äôs new limitations and possibilities *the writing itself would evolve;* the shorter the distance between the raw material of words and their processed output, the more entwined the content and form from the outset. This line of thinking was more famously expounded by Benjamin in his 1936 essay ‚ÄúThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,‚Äù which more broadly argues that an authentic, pertinent art is the result of engagement with the latest technological innovations.
