Choose an original text and publish it as a website consisting of at least 3 pages. The text you use should be written by you, but it can be any format. It could be a single longer text broken up into 3 components, or a compilation of disparate texts. Consider how the type relates to each other and their hierarchy, through scale, texture, and color of the text. What form of readership is appropriate for  Images may be used, but the typography should be the primary design elements.
