> “But in any context, large or small, designing the medium is managing the potentials and relationships between objects, the activity or disposition immanent in their organization.”
– Keller Eastering

### Project 2

Create a variable font, considering the axes of variation as a medium. With this format, you are not only designing the visual instances of letterforms — you are designing the relationship with the typographer (or anyone who uses the font.) What power and possibilities are you granting with your variable font? If you can choose [any kind of axes](https://v-fonts.com/) for variation, what is the significance of that choice?

### Project 3

Create a typographic website for your typeface, as a specimen that responds to specific conditions enabled by the web. 


## Week 1

- define your typographic concept(s)
- determine the scope of your font
	- you might work from an existing design — something you’ve designed in the past 
	- if starting a new design, consider limiting your character set
- articulate the *axis for variation* as an intentional design space
- develop several sketches or approaches
  - begin with the control characters: H, O, D, n, o, p.
  - These characters provide the “DNA” of a typeface: its straight shapes, its curved shapes, and the combination of the two.
  - When drawing letters, you will be designing both the black and white shapes: the positive space as well as the negative space both within the counters of the letters and the space formed between the letters. 
  *Pay careful attention to these inside/outside shapes.*



## Week 2

* complete basic character set 
* begin developing website for font-in-use specimen
* consider the following questions for your typeface:
  - how does the font take advantage of its mode of construction?
  - how can not only the shapes of the letters, but the actual transformation itself become part of your concept?
  - how can your typeface demonstrate a commentary; a point of view?
* consider the following questions for your website:
  - how is your axis of variation activated by the web?
  - what should it respond to?
    - is it user input? a browser width change? external data? time? sound?
    - what is the significance of this “response” in combination with the text that we see?

## Week 3

* refine and finalize typeface
  - are there other variants to consider
* flesh out your website specimen
  - what is the journey created through the website?
  - how can you showcase different components of your typeface?
  - what typeface are you pairing with your typeface? (since most of you are drawing display faces, select a text face to match your font.)
* design the responsive version
  - use `@media` queries to make a mobile-friendly version
  - how does your typography adapt to the smaller screen?
* consider expanding what and how you’re curating your content: use JavaScript, JSON, or APIs to enhance the use of your typeface on the web
