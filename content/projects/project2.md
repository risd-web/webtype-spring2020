> “But in any context, large or small, designing the medium is managing the potentials and relationships between objects, the activity or disposition immanent in their organization.”

Project 2: Create a variable font, considering the axes of variation as a medium. With this format, you are not only designing the visual instances of letterforms — you are designing the relationship with the typographer (or anyone who uses the font.) What power and possibilities are you granting with your variable font? If you can choose [any kind of axes](https://v-fonts.com/) for variation, what is the significance of that choice?

Project 3: Create a typographic website for your typeface, as a specimen that responds to specific conditions enabled by the web.
Is it user input — what kind of input? Or an external text or data source? Consider a website that isn’t simply ”about” the typeface but one that showcases interesting uses of the font and its variations.

## Week 1

* define your typographic concept(s)
* determine the scope of your font
	* you might work from an existing design — something you’ve designed in the past 
	* if starting a new design, consider limiting your character set
* articulate the axes for variation as an intentional design space
* develop several sketches or approaches
  * begin with the control characters: H, O, D, n, o, p.

## Week 2

* complete basic character set
* begin developing concept for font-in-use specimen
  - what should it *respond* to?
* plan and sketch website designs

## Week 3

* refine typeface
* develop prototype for your website specimen

## Week 4

* finalize typeface
* finalize website specimen
