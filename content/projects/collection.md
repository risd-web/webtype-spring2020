### Documentation

Develop a single webpage that provides a link to each project youâ€™ve completed this semester. This index page will serve as a homepage for this class. You might also include exercises or alternate drafts that you experimented before developing the final version of your website. As you organize / reorganize your Github repository, make sure to double check that all links, including assets such as fonts and images, are properly linked.

This site will serve as documentation for all of your work this semester. Please provide the URL for your index page before the final class.
