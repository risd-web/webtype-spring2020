      <description>WEB TYPE (RISD GRAPH-2313-01) 3 credits Marie Otsuka (motsuka@risd.edu)  This course explores typography within the browser, considering the web not as a container but as a medium. We will develop typography that activates the capacities and conditions of websites. Projects will first respond our local browser conditions and different device environments, then expand to working with the remote network as source material. Critique and discussions will examine how publishing on the internet entails a distinct form of engagement and experience.</description>

      <description>“But in any context, large or small, designing the medium is managing the potentials and relationships between objects, the activity or disposition immanent in their organization.” – Keller Eastering
 Reading  Keller Easterling: Medium Design (Excerpt) Typotheque: Typeface as Programme  Project 2 Create a variable font, considering the axes of variation as a medium. With this format, you are not only designing the visual instances of letterforms — you are designing the relationship with the typographer (or anyone who uses the font.</description>

 How would you like people to move through the experience? How can you attract them and keep them engaged?   Entice  How are visitors invited to participate? How are they invited to the space in the first place?   Enter  What is the threshold moment where a visitor transitions from their world to yours?</description>

      <description>“My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle? Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity.</description>

      <description>This course is purposely named with shortened, less precise versions the words “web” and “type” to broaden our perspective on our explorations.
Web could refer to websites, but also to the web infrastructure, to the technology and culture of the world wide web; the protocols that compose the fabric of our internet; the act of weaving a web.
Type could refer to typography — the arrangement of letterforms — but also typefaces themselves, the quality of letterforms; to type, the act of typing, or writing, or coding.</description>
